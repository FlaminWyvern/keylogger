# keylogger
This keylogger detects any pressed key and writes their equivalent character in a text file. 

For example, if the user were to press the following keys: 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', "Enter", 'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', 'backspace', 'backspace', the file would contain:
"hello\n (newline won't appear in file, I just put it there to show that there is a newline)
wor"
